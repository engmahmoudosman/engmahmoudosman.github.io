During my Master's program, one of the most rewarding experiences was taking the Analog Circuit Design Lab. It offered the perfect blend of theory and hands-on practice, allowing me to engage deeply with essential hardware tools and analog principles that power real-world electronics.

## What I worked on

### 1. Computer-based simulations
  Noise Analysis in PSpice: Simulated transistor and OpAmp circuits to evaluate noise behavior and spectral characteristics, comparing inverting vs. non-inverting topologies.

### 2. Electronic Lab Experiments
#### 2.1 Active Bandpass filter
    In this task I designed 2nd order active band pass filter using LM4562 op-amp by cascading two staggered tuned first order bandpass filters. To build the two filter stages, multi-feedback topology is used. Butterworth filter specifications were used in the design.
