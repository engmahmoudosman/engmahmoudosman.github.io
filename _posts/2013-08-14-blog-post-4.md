 During my Master's program, one of the most rewarding experiences was taking the Analog Circuit Design Lab. It offered the perfect blend of theory and hands-on practice, allowing me to engage deeply with essential hardware tools and analog principles that power real-world electronics.

- **What I worked on:**
  - **Computer-based simulations:**  
    - Simulated transistor and OpAmp circuits in PSpice for noise analysis.  
    - Compared noise behavior and spectral characteristics of inverting vs. non-inverting topologies.

  - **Electronic Lab Experiments:**  
    - **Active Bandpass Filter:**  
      - Designed a 2nd order active bandpass filter using the LM4562 op-amp.  
      - Used a multiple-feedback topology and Butterworth filter specs.

    - **ADC Driver + Anti-Aliasing Filter:**  
      - Built a single-ended to differential driver for the AD7626 ADC with a 2nd-order low-pass filter.  
      - Compared simulation and lab-based signal responses; calculated SNR and ENOB.
    - **Switched Capacitor Filter with Preamplifier stage:**  
      - Developed a 5th-order clock-tunable SC filter using LT1063 with a preamp stage.  
      - Examined tuning effects, input-output behavior, and output noise.

- **Skills Demonstrated:**
  - Analog circuit design and manual dimensioning
  - Advanced SPICE simulation and frequency domain analysis
  - Precise use of test equipment (oscilloscope, function generator, signal analysis tools)
  - Noise measurement, signal fidelity analysis, and performance comparison between simulation and real-world data
  - Systematic preparation of lab reports, calculations, and MATLAB-based data visualization
