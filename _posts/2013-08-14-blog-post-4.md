During my Master's program, one of the most rewarding experiences was taking the Analog Circuit Design Lab. It offered the perfect blend of theory and hands-on practice, allowing me to engage deeply with essential hardware tools and analog principles that power real-world electronics.

## What I worked on

### 1. Computer-based simulations
  Noise Analysis in PSpice: Simulated transistor and OpAmp circuits to evaluate noise behavior and spectral characteristics, comparing inverting vs. non-inverting topologies.

### 2. Electronic Lab Experiments

#### 2.1 Active Bandpass Filter

In this task, I designed a 2nd order active bandpass filter using the LM4562 op-amp by cascading two staggered-tuned first-order bandpass filters. To build the two filter stages, a multiple-feedback topology was used. Butterworth filter specifications guided the design.
