I am beyond grateful for the opportunity to represent my graduating class and deliver the commencement speech. It was truly an honor to stand before my peers, professors, family, and friends to share my thoughts on our journey and the exciting future ahead.

Iâ€™m excited to share my speech with you! You can watch it here:
