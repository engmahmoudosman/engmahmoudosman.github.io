 I had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of Radio Frequency (RF) Engineering through a comprehensive lab course. The lab gave me hands-on experience working with RF components, transmission lines, S-parameters, and antennas—all supported by industry-standard measurement tools like vector network analyzers, spectrum analyzers, function generators, and oscilloscopes.
 From coaxial lines to horn antennas, I analyzed how energy behaves at high frequencies—bridging the gap between theoretical electromagnetic systems and real-world RF circuits.

## What I Explored:
     
- **Coaxial Transmission Lines**    
  - Measured standing wave ratio (VSWR) and reflection coefficients using a movable E-field probe.
  - Investigated the effect of various terminations (open, short, matched, capacitive, resistive) on wave propagation.
  - Used a spectrum analyzer to visualize spatial electric fields and wave patterns.
  - Applied Smith Chart analysis to calculate load impedances and matching strategies.
   
- **Time Domain Reflectometry**  
  - Used rectangular pulses and a 74F3037 line driver to observe signal reflections from coaxial cables under various load conditions.
  - Measured rise/fall times, propagation delays, and calculated dielectric constants.
  - Determined unknown cable lengths and analyzed the effects of capacitive and inductive terminations.

- **S-Parameters and Network Analysis**  
  - Calibrated and operated a vector network analyzer (VNA) to measure S-parameters of filters, microstrip lines, circulators, and power dividers.
  - Displayed S11 (reflection) and S21 (transmission) using both magnitude/phase and Smith chart formats.
  - Investigated a 3-port resistive divider and circulators, exploring port isolation and impedance matching.

- **Antenna Characteristics and Radiation Patterns**  
  - Measured radiation patterns of horn antennas and phased antenna arrays at 1, 2, and 3 GHz.
  - Compared antenna patterns with equal-phase and phase-shifted feeds.
  - Analyzed real antenna behavior using theoretical models in MATLAB and Excel, comparing gain and directivity with actual lab results.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- RF measurement using VNA, TDR, spectrum analyzer, and oscilloscope
- Smith chart interpretation and impedance transformation
- Matching network design (transmission line + capacitor)
- Understanding of microstrip design principles and their real-world applications
- Radiation pattern measurement and phased antenna theory
- Proficiency in high-frequency signal handling and system calibration
